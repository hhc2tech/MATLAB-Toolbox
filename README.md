# MATLAB-Toolbox
This toolbox includes Distmesh, Mesh, NURBS, NURL, QuadNurbs, SurfaceIntersection, Trimming and TriNurbs Toolbox， where the Distmesh, NURBS and SurfaceIntersection toolboxes are accomplished by Per-Olof Persson and Gilbert Strang (A Simple Mesh Generator in MATLAB, SIAM Review Vol. 46 (2) 2004), D.M. Spink and Penguian (https://www.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26390-nurbs-toolbox-by-d-m-spink), Tomas Möller (A Fast Triangle-Triangle Intersection Test, Journal of Graphics Tools, 2(2)). For the sake of integrity and completeness, I add these researchers' work. Please refer to the corresponding references and the program introductions on their own website.
